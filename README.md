# Hi, I'm Kyle!

I currently am VP of Growth & Analytics at [Jobcase](https://www.jobcase.com/) in Cambridge, MA. I previously was a Senior Data Scientist at Instagram. My career has been about using data to make better business decisions.

In addition to my GitHub, you can check out:

I created [Chess Stamps](https://github.com/khgiddon/chess-stamps), a tool to present statistics on your chess games played on Lichess and compare your opening repertoire to other players.
