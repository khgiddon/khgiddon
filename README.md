# Hi, I'm Kyle!

I currently lead the product analytics team at [Jobcase](https://www.jobcase.com/) in Cambridge, MA, bringing data-driven insights to solve business problems, define strategy, and move key metrics. The key theme throughout my career has been using data to apply rigor and make better decisions.
